        <p><i>A mouth-watering plate of spicy chicken noodles</i></p>
        <p>No matter what recipe they're used in, rice noodles are a proven crowd-pleaser. I think this spicy <br> 
            chicken noodles dish is perfect for using up leftover chicken, assuming it wasn't horribly overcooked <br>
            in the first place. If you did want to use raw chicken, go ahead and chop it up, and stir-fry it for a <br>
            minute or two before adding your vegetables.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Vegetables:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large carrot, finely sliced or shredded</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded green cabbage</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, seeded and minced</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped green onions</li>
            <li>3 cloes garlic, finely crushed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Sauce:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>¼ cup seasoned rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon hoisin sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sriracha hot sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Noodles:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 package dried rice noodles</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>8 ounces cooked chicken breast, torn into bite-sized pieces</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>½ cup freshly chopped cilantro</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Place carrots, cabbage, bell pepper, jalapeno pepper, green onions, and garlic in a mixing bowl. </li>
        <li>Mix chicken broth, rice vinegar, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, ketchup, brown sugar, <br>sriracha sauce, and red pepper flakes together in a separate mixing bowl. </li>
        <li>Place dry rice noodles in a large mixing bowl. Cover with about 6 cups boiling water; add a <br> pinch of salt. Stir from time to time until noodles are soft, about 10 minutes. Drain; cool with <br> cold water. Drain thoroughly. Transfer to a mixing bowl. Add shredded chicken; drizzle with <br>sesame oil. Toss to coat. </li>
        <li>Heat large skillet over high heat; drizzle in vegetable oil. When oil is hot (almost but not quite <br>smoking), add the vegetable mixture. Cook and stir until vegetables are hot and steamy, <br>1 or 2 minutes. Pour in sauce; cook and stir over high heat until sauce starts to bubble, about 1<br> minute. Add noodles and chicken. Cook and stir to blend ingredients and ensure ingredients <br>are hot, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Add chopped cilantro; stir. </li>
